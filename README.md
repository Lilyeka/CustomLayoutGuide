# CustomLayoutGuide
Suppose I have four views that are to remain equally distributed vertically. I constrain their left and right edges, their heights, and the top of the first view and the bottom of the last view. This leaves open the question of how we will determine the vertical position of the two middle views; they must move in such a way that they are always equidistant from their vertical neighbors
